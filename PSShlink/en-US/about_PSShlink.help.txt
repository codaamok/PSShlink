LONG DESCRIPTION
    PSShlink is an unofficial PowerShell module for Shlink (https://shlink.io),
    an open-source self-hosted and PHP-based URL shortener application.

    To learn how to use any of the functions, it is recommended you make use of
    the command: `Get-Help <functionName>`. For example,
    `Get-Help Get-ShlinkUrl` will show you how to use the Get-ShlinkUrl
    function.

    You can also find documentation for each of the functions of PSShlink on the
    project's GitHub repository: https://github.com/codaamok/PSShlink.

    If you experience any issues with PSShlink, please raise an issue on GitHub.

AUTHENTICATION
    Each function will have two parameters for authentication to your Shlink 
    instance:
    
        -ShlinkServer: a string value of the Shlink server address 
        e.g. https://example.com
        -ShlinkApiKey: a SecureString value for the Shlink server's API key

    After using any function of PSShlink for the first time after importing the
    module - which have both parameters -ShlinkServer and -ShlinkApiKey * - it
    is not necessary to use the parameters again in subsequent uses for other 
    functions of PSShlink. These values are held in memory for as long as the 
    PowerShell session exists.

    * Some functions do not require both -ShlinkServer and -ShlinkApiKey, e.g. 
    Get-ShlinkServer. Therefore if the first function you use after importing 
    PSShlink accepts only -ShlinkServer, you will not be asked again for this 
    value by other functions of PSShlink. You will however be prompted for the
    API key. Again, subsequent uses of other functions will no longer require
    -ShlinkServer and -ShlinkApiKey.

    If the first function you use after importing PSShlink requires
    -ShlinkServer and/or -ShlinkApiKey and you have not passed the parameter(s),
    you will be prompted for them.
